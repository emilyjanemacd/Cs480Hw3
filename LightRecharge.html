                By accepting this agreement you enter into a binding and eternal contract with the ruinous powers to
               engage in full and total custodianship of (1) human soul, granted to you in exchange for the payment
               described in your purchase summary. You will also be mailed a frozen fish as described to you in the
               listing. This fish, henceforth called the “fish vessel”, represents the binding terms of your
               custodianship, and must be kept frozen at all times to avoid the risk of an all-consuming flame that can
               never be quenched. You hereby indemnify Cob’s of any harm caused by allowing the fish vessel to
               thaw, including but not limited to property damage, incineration, and the formation of gaping maws of
               despair on your property.
               By consuming the fish vessel, you forfeit any rights to the above contracted soul, and agree to render
               your soul onto Cob’s, or our chosen agent, upon your expiration. To cancel this contract at any time,
               simply resurrect the fish vessel using the necromantic arts, then cast the living fish vessel into a suitable
               void, no less than 24 miles deep. Attach a notarized copy of your name, social security number, order
               number, and exact second of birth to ensure processing of your cancellation.
